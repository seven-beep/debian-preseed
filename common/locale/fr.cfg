# Locale, TZ and Keyboard

# Notice you do NEED to install console-setup to make this work
#

# Preseeding only locale sets language, country and locale.
d-i debian-installer/locale string fr_FR

# Ugh. I am not rebooting this a 42nth time to trim that.
# I wanted the TZ in France, locale in US, keyboard in FR, but after hours,
# I still don't know how to do that with d-i as my configurations was often ignored.
